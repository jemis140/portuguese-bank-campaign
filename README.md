# portuguese-bank-campaign

The Portuguese Bank had run a telemarketing campaign in the past, making sales calls for a term-deposit product. Whether a prospect had bought the product or not is mentioned in the column named 'response'.


Goal achieved:

•	Reduce the marketing cost by X% and acquire Y% of the prospects (compared to random calling), where X and Y are to be maximized
•	Present the financial benefit of this project to the marketing team
